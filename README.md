# PoET-Proof-of-Elapsed-Time-
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
Proof of elapsed time (PoET) is a blockchain network consensus mechanism that prevents high resource utilization and energy consumption; it keeps the process more efficient by following a fair lottery system. The algorithm uses a randomly generated elapsed time to decide mining rights and block winners on a blockchain network. By running a trusted code within a secure environment, the PoET algorithm also enhances transparency by ensuring lottery results are verifiable by external participants.
In this assignment, we have designed a land management system which operates on an underlying blockchain that uses PoEt (Proof of Elapsed Time consensus mechanism). The system encompasses the following functionalities:
1. The platform allows users to register themselves with previously owned property.
2. Once a user is registered with the platform, he/she is assigned a unique Identification number. Along with this, private and public keys are generated for the user and stored in the database.
3. A user is able to buy and sell the property using tokens. Each time a new property is registered, a token is generated which is verified by cryptographically.
4. Implementation of Merkle root to calculate the hash of all the transactions in a block.
5. Provides functionality to view the transaction history that is related to a particular property


Instructions to run the code:
1. Ensure that all the python scripts are in the same working directory.
2. Delete any existing ‘.db’ file(s).
3. Run the main.py python script.
